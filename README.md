## How to run a large language model locally with Ollama and Docker (Downloading Model Directly from Ollama):

---

### Step 1: Install Required Software

You'll need to install the following software to run Ollama and Docker:

-   **Docker Desktop:** This is an application that helps you run, manage, and deploy applications inside containers.
-   **Visual Studio Code** (or any code editor): You will use this to create a configuration file.

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Docker Container

1.  **Create a folder** for your project.
2.  **Open the folder** in your code editor and create a new file named `docker-compose.yml`.
3.  **Add the following code** to the file to define your Ollama service:

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
services:
    ollama:
        container_name: ollama
        image: ollama/ollama:latest
        volumes:
            - ollama_models:/root/.ollama
        ports:
            - 11434:11434
        restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
    ollama_models:
        name: ollama_models
```

-   `container_name`: Gives your container a simple name.
-   `image`: Specifies the Docker image to use. `ollama/ollama:latest` tells Docker to use the most recent version of Ollama
-   `ports`: Exposes port `11434` from the container to the same port on your local machine, allowing you to access it.
-   `volumes`: Creates a dedicated storage location for your downloaded models so they aren't lost if the container is stopped or restarted.
-   `restart: always`: Ensures the container automatically restarts if it crashes.
-   `restart: unless-stopped`: (Alternative) Restart unless stopped by the user
-   `service`: The parts of the system that we are setting up. In our case it is Ollama but it can be a Flask API or a PHP server

-   Note:

    -   A Dockerfile isn't needed here because you are using a pre-existing Docker image. The docker-compose.yml file specifies image: ollama/ollama:latest, which instructs Docker to pull an image that has already been built and is available on Docker Hub. This image contains all the necessary components to run Ollama, so you don't need to define the build instructions yourself.

    -

---

### Step 3: Run the Ollama Container

1.  **Open your terminal** and navigate to the folder where you saved the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2.  Run the following command to start the container: `docker compose up -d`
3.  Verify that the container is running by opening **Docker Desktop**. You should see a container named `ollama` in your list.

-   Note: `docker compose up`: This part of the command reads the docker-compose.yml file in the current directory. This file defines the services, networks, and volumes required for your application. It then performs the following actions:

    -   Builds images: If any of the services are defined with a build instruction (e.g., they need to be built from a Dockerfile), Docker Compose will build those images.
    -   Creates and starts containers: It creates a container for each service defined in the file and starts them up.
    -   Attaches to output: By default, docker compose up attaches to the output of all the containers, displaying their logs in your terminal. This is useful for debugging and seeing what's happening.

    -   d (Detached Mode): This is the flag that modifies the default behavior. It's a shorthand for --detach. When you add -d, Docker Compose runs the containers in the background. The command prompt is immediately returned to you, and you can continue using your terminal for other tasks. The containers will continue to run even if you close the terminal window.

---

### Step 4: Download a Model

1.  Return to your terminal.

2.  Use the following command to download a model inside your running Ollama container:
    `docker exec -it ollama ollama pull tinyllama`

    -   `docker exec -it ollama`: Executes a command inside the container named `ollama`.
    -   `ollama pull tinyllama`: The command that tells Ollama to download the `tinyllama` model.
    -   **Note:** You can replace `tinyllama` with any model from the [Ollama models page](https://ollama.com/library).

---

### Step 5: Test the Model with a Request

Once the model is downloaded, the Ollama service is ready to receive requests. You can use an API client like **Postman** to test it.

1.  Create a **new POST request**.

2.  Enter the URL: `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`

3.  Go to the **Body** tab, select **raw** and set the format to **JSON**.

4.  Enter the following JSON object, customizing the `model`, `prompt`, and other parameters as you wish:

    ```json
    {
    	"model": "tinyllama",
    	"prompt": "Give a short shopping list for a normal week. Include food, cleaning, and self-care. Only one or two items per category.",
    	"stream": false,
    	"options": {
    		"max_tokens": 50,
    		"temperature": 0.7
    	}
    }
    ```

5.  **Send the request.** The model will process the prompt and return a response in the body of the reply.

By following these steps, you have successfully set up a private, local large language model that you can use for your personal projects. You can easily move this setup to a cloud server to deploy your own private AI API.

## How to run a large language model locally with Ollama and Docker (Using Model downloaded Locally Already):

-   To use a pre-downloaded Hugging Face model by changing how the Docker volume is configured and how you import the model into Ollama. The key is to use a **bind mount** to connect your local folder to the Docker container, allowing Ollama to access the model file directly.
-   The file need to be in `.gguf` format

---

### Step 1: Install Required Software

You'll need to install the following software to run Ollama and Docker:

-   **Docker Desktop:** This is an application that helps you run, manage, and deploy applications inside containers.
-   **Visual Studio Code** (or any code editor): You will use this to create a configuration file.

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Docker Container

1.  **Create a folder** for your project.
2.  **Place your downloaded Hugging Face model file** (e.g., `model-file.gguf`) inside this new project folder.
3.  **Open the folder** in your code editor and create a new file named `docker-compose.yml`.
4.  **Add the following code** to the file to define your Ollama service:

<!-- end list -->

```yaml
services:
    ollama:
        container_name: ollama
        image: ollama/ollama:latest
        volumes:
            - ollama_models:/root/.ollama
        ports:
            - 11434:11434
        restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
    ollama_models:
        name: ollama_models
```

-   `container_name`: Gives your container a simple name.
-   `image`: Specifies the Docker image to use. `ollama/ollama:latest` tells Docker to use the most recent version of Ollama.
-   `ports`: Exposes port `11434` from the container to the same port on your local machine, allowing you to access it.
-   `volumes`: Creates a dedicated storage location for your downloaded models so they aren't lost if the container is stopped or restarted.
    -   **`./ollama_models:/root/.ollama`**: This is the critical change. It creates a **bind mount** that maps the `ollama_models` folder in your local project directory (`./ollama_models`) to the Ollama model directory inside the container (`/root/.ollama`). Any files you place in your local `ollama_models` folder will now be visible to the Ollama container.
-   `restart: always`: Ensures the container automatically restarts if it crashes.
-   `restart: unless-stopped`: (Alternative) Restart unless stopped by the user
-   `service`: The parts of the system that we are setting up. In our case it is Ollama but it can be a Flask API or a PHP server

---

### Step 3: Run the Ollama Container

1.  **Open your terminal** and navigate to the folder where you saved the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2.  Run the following command to start the container: `docker compose up -d`
3.  Verify that the container is running by opening **Docker Desktop**. You should see a container named `ollama` in your list.

-   Note: `docker compose up`: This part of the command reads the docker-compose.yml file in the current directory. This file defines the services, networks, and volumes required for your application. It then performs the following actions:

    -   Builds images: If any of the services are defined with a build instruction (e.g., they need to be built from a Dockerfile), Docker Compose will build those images.
    -   Creates and starts containers: It creates a container for each service defined in the file and starts them up.
    -   Attaches to output: By default, docker compose up attaches to the output of all the containers, displaying their logs in your terminal. This is useful for debugging and seeing what's happening.

    -   d (Detached Mode): This is the flag that modifies the default behavior. It's a shorthand for --detach. When you add -d, Docker Compose runs the containers in the background. The command prompt is immediately returned to you, and you can continue using your terminal for other tasks. The containers will continue to run even if you close the terminal window.

---

### Step 4A: Create a Modelfile for a single model from hugging face

Before running the container, you need to create a **Modelfile** that tells Ollama to import your specific Hugging Face model file.

1.  In your project folder, create a new file named `Modelfile`.
2.  Add the following code to the file, replacing `model-file.gguf` with the actual filename of your downloaded model.

<!-- end list -->

```
FROM ./ollama_models/model-file.gguf
```

```
my-ollama-project/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Modelfile
└── ollama_models/
    └── model-file.gguf
```

### Step 4B: Create a Modelfile for multimodal or split models from hugging face

A common scenario with multimodal or split models from Hugging Face. The two files you mentioned, `cardvault-500m-mmproj-f16.gguf` and `cardvault-500m-q5_k_m.gguf`, are likely a vision model and a language model, respectively. The `.gguf` file with `mmproj` in its name is the vision projector, which allows the model to process images.

```
FROM ./ollama_models/cardvault-500m-mmproj-f16.gguf
ADAPTER ./ollama_models/cardvault-500m-q5_k_m.gguf
```

-   **`FROM`**: This instruction is still required and should point to the multimodal projector file (`-mmproj-`). This file contains the logic needed to process and "understand" image data.
-   **`ADAPTER`**: This instruction is used to load a **LoRA adapter** or, in this case, a separate GGUF file that functions as a component of the base model. This tells Ollama to load the second `.gguf` file (`-q5_k_m.gguf`) alongside the vision projector.

```
my-ollama-project/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Modelfile
└── ollama_models/
    ├── cardvault-500m-mmproj-f16.gguf
    └── cardvault-500m-q5_k_m.gguf
```

---

### Step 4: Run the Ollama Container and Import the Model

1.  Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder.
2.  Start the container with the command: `docker compose up -d`
3.  Once the container is running, use the following command to import your model into Ollama. This will create a new Ollama model based on your `Modelfile` and your downloaded `.gguf` file.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama create my-huggingface-model -f ./Modelfile
```

-   `docker exec -it ollama`: Executes a command inside your running Ollama container.
-   `ollama create my-huggingface-model -f ./Modelfile`: Tells Ollama to create a new model named `my-huggingface-model` using the instructions in your `Modelfile`.

---

### Step 6: Test the Model with a Request

Once the model is downloaded, the Ollama service is ready to receive requests. You can use an API client like **Postman** to test it.

1.  Create a **new POST request**.

2.  Enter the URL: `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`

3.  Go to the **Body** tab, select **raw** and set the format to **JSON**.

4.  Enter the following JSON object, customizing the `model`, `prompt`, and other parameters as you wish:

    ```json
    {
    	"model": "tinyllama",
    	"prompt": "Give a short shopping list for a normal week. Include food, cleaning, and self-care. Only one or two items per category.",
    	"stream": false,
    	"options": {
    		"max_tokens": 50,
    		"temperature": 0.7
    	}
    }
    ```

5.  **Send the request.** The model will process the prompt and return a response in the body of the reply.

By following these steps, you have successfully set up a private, local large language model that you can use for your personal projects. You can easily move this setup to a cloud server to deploy your own private AI API.

# Alternative with DockerFile Approach

## Model Retrieve From Ollama Library. Downloaded At Setup

While you can't replicate the `docker-compose.yml` file's functionality with a single Dockerfile, you can achieve the same result using a combination of a **Dockerfile** and `docker` commands. A `Dockerfile` is used for **building a custom image**, while `docker-compose` and direct `docker` commands are used for **running and managing containers**.

A `Dockerfile` doesn't manage container names, ports, volumes, or restart policies; these are runtime configurations. The original `docker-compose.yml` file is all about setting up these runtime configurations for a pre-existing image.

---

You'll need a `Dockerfile` to create a new, custom image that includes the `tinyllama` model, and then you'll run it using `docker` commands to handle the port mapping and volume.

### Step 1: Create the Dockerfile

First, create a `Dockerfile` with the following content.

```dockerfile
# Use the official Ollama image as the base
FROM ollama/ollama:latest

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Pull the tinyllama model during the build process
RUN ollama pull tinyllama

# Expose the default Ollama port
EXPOSE 11434

# Command to run when the container starts
CMD ["ollama", "serve"]
```

-   `FROM ollama/ollama:latest`: This line starts with the official Ollama image, which is the same as the `docker-compose` file.
-   `RUN ollama pull tinyllama`: This command is the key difference. It executes the `ollama pull tinyllama` command during the image build process, embedding the model directly into the new image.
-   `EXPOSE 11434`: This line documents that the container listens on port `11434`. It doesn't actually publish the port; you'll do that with the `docker run` command.
-   `CMD ["ollama", "serve"]`: This specifies the command that will run when the container starts.

---

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Open your terminal in the same directory as your `Dockerfile` and run the following command to build the image.

```bash
docker build -t my-ollama-with-tinyllama .
```

-   `docker build`: This command builds a new image from the `Dockerfile`.
-   `-t my-ollama-with-tinyllama`: This tags the new image with a memorable name.
-   `.`: This tells Docker to look for the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

This process will take some time as it downloads the `ollama/ollama:latest` base image and then the `tinyllama` model.

---

### Step 3: Run the Docker Container

Now, use the `docker run` command to start the container, mimicking the functionality of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker run -d \
--name ollama \
-p 11434:11434 \
-v ollama_models:/root/.ollama \
--restart unless-stopped \
my-ollama-with-tinyllama
```

-   `docker run`: The command to create and start a container.
-   `-d`: Runs the container in **detached mode**, similar to the `-d` flag in `docker-compose up`.
-   `--name ollama`: Sets the container name to **ollama**, just like in the `docker-compose` file.
-   `-p 11434:11434`: Publishes port **11434** from the container to your local machine, same as `ports` in the `docker-compose` file.
-   `-v ollama_models:/root/.ollama`: Creates a named volume called **ollama_models** and mounts it to the `/root/.ollama` directory inside the container, preserving your data.
-   `--restart unless-stopped`: Sets the container's restart policy, ensuring it automatically restarts unless you explicitly stop it, mirroring the `restart` policy in the `docker-compose` file.
-   `my-ollama-with-tinyllama`: The name of the custom image you just built.

This single `docker run` command combines all the runtime settings from the `docker-compose` file to launch your container with the pre-loaded `tinyllama` model.

## With Model Downloaded Before Docker Setup

You can achieve the same outcome by combining a `Dockerfile` to pre-import your model and a `docker run` command to manage the container's runtime settings.

---

### The Dockerfile and `docker run` Approach

The key difference from the previous scenario is that you're starting with a local `.gguf` file and a `Modelfile`. The `Dockerfile` will handle the process of creating a new custom image that includes your model, and the `docker run` command will handle the port and volume mapping.

---

### Step 1: Create the Project Structure

First, make sure your project directory is set up with the correct files and folders.

-   `my-ollama-project/`
    -   `Dockerfile`
    -   `Modelfile`
    -   `ollama_models/`
        -   `model-file.gguf`

The `Modelfile` should contain the correct instructions for your model, either `FROM ./ollama_models/model-file.gguf` for a single model or `FROM ./ollama_models/cardvault-500m-mmproj-f16.gguf` and `ADAPTER ./ollama_models/cardvault-500m-q5_k_m.gguf` for a multimodal model.

---

### Step 2: Create the Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of your project directory with the following content. This `Dockerfile` will create a new image based on the official Ollama image and then use your `Modelfile` to create and embed the `my-huggingface-model` into the image during the build process.

```dockerfile
# Use the official Ollama image as the base
FROM ollama/ollama:latest

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the Modelfile and the ollama_models directory into the container image
COPY ./Modelfile ./Modelfile
COPY ./ollama_models/ ./ollama_models/

# Create the model using the Modelfile.
# This embeds the model into the new Docker image.
RUN ollama create my-huggingface-model -f ./Modelfile

# Expose the default Ollama port
EXPOSE 11434

# Set the default command for when the container starts
CMD ["ollama", "serve"]
```

-   `COPY ./Modelfile ./Modelfile`: This copies your `Modelfile` from your local machine into the Docker image.
-   `COPY ./ollama_models/ ./ollama_models/`: This copies the entire `ollama_models` directory and its contents (your `.gguf` files) into the Docker image.
-   `RUN ollama create my-huggingface-model -f ./Modelfile`: This is the crucial step. It runs the `ollama create` command inside the container **during the image build process**, which imports your local `.gguf` file into an Ollama model named `my-huggingface-model`.

---

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

Open your terminal in the `my-ollama-project` directory and run the following command to build your custom Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t my-ollama-with-custom-model .
```

-   `docker build`: The command to build a new image.
-   `-t my-ollama-with-custom-model`: Tags the image with a name you can easily reference later.
-   `.`: Specifies that the build context is the current directory, where your `Dockerfile`, `Modelfile`, and `ollama_models` folder are located.

This process will create a new image that has the Ollama application and your custom model already imported and ready to go.

---

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container

Now, use the `docker run` command to start the container with the necessary runtime settings, effectively replacing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker run -d \
--name ollama \
-p 11434:11434 \
-v ollama_data:/root/.ollama \
--restart unless-stopped \
my-ollama-with-custom-model
```

-   `docker run`: The command to create and run a container.
-   `-d`: Runs in detached mode.
-   `--name ollama`: Sets the container name.
-   `-p 11434:11434`: Maps the container's port to your local machine.
-   `-v ollama_data:/root/.ollama`: Creates a named volume to persist model data. Note that since you've already embedded the model in the image, this volume will primarily be used for future models or data generated by Ollama. You could also use a bind mount like `-v ./ollama_models:/root/.ollama` to keep your local files in sync.
-   `--restart unless-stopped`: Sets the restart policy.
-   `my-ollama-with-custom-model`: The name of the image you just built in the previous step.

This single command launches the container with all the necessary configurations, and since the model was pre-imported during the build, it's immediately available for use.

# ISSUE 1: We have two containers running an image of Ollama using two different models

## SOLUTION 1:

If you have two independent Docker containers running Ollama with two different models, they will operate as two separate, isolated Ollama servers. This is a common and effective strategy for managing multiple models on a single machine, especially when they need to be accessed concurrently or have different configurations.

Here's what happens and how to manage it:

### 1\. Port Conflicts and Resolution

Since each Ollama container exposes the same internal port (`11434`), you'll need to **map them to different ports on your host machine** to avoid conflicts. For example:

-   **Container 1 (`ollama-llama2`)**: Mapped to host port `11434`
-   **Container 2 (`ollama-mistral`)**: Mapped to host port `11435`

This allows you to address each container independently using its specific port, e.g., `http://localhost:11434` for the first container and `http://localhost:11435` for the second.

### 2\. Resource Management

Running two independent Ollama containers can increase overall resource consumption, especially **VRAM (GPU memory)**. Each container will load its assigned model into memory. This means your machine's GPU must have enough VRAM to accommodate both models simultaneously.

-   **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, preventing one model from interfering with the other. This makes debugging and maintenance much easier.
-   **Concurrency**: This setup allows you to handle requests for different models simultaneously, as each container can process requests independently. This is useful for applications that need to switch between models or serve multiple users with different models.

### 3\. Model and Data Persistence

For each container, you should use a **named volume or bind mount** to ensure the models and their data persist across container restarts. While you can use the same volume for both containers, it's a best practice to use a separate volume for each to maintain true isolation and avoid potential conflicts. For example:

-   `ollama-llama2`: Uses a volume named `ollama_models_llama2`
-   `ollama-mistral`: Uses a volume named `ollama_models_mistral`

This ensures that the models and any associated data are not lost if a container is removed.

### 4\. How to Set Up with `docker run`

Here's an example of the `docker run` commands you would use to start two independent containers:

**Container 1 (`llama2` on port `11434`)**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ollama-llama2 \
  -p 11434:11434 \
  -v ollama_models_llama2:/root/.ollama \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ollama/ollama:latest \
  ollama serve
```

**Container 2 (`mistral` on port `11435`)**

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name ollama-mistral \
  -p 11435:11434 \
  -v ollama_models_mistral:/root/.ollama \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ollama/ollama:latest \
  ollama serve
```

After starting the containers, you can use `docker exec` to pull the desired model into each one:

```bash
# Pull llama2 into the first container
docker exec -it ollama-llama2 ollama pull llama2

# Pull mistral into the second container
docker exec -it ollama-mistral ollama pull mistral
```

# ASIDE

## Differences between Dockerfile vs Docker Compose

### Dockerfile vs. Docker Compose

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a new Docker image. Think of it as a recipe. When you use the `docker build` command, Docker reads the Dockerfile and executes the instructions (like installing software, copying files, and setting up the environment) to create a new, custom image. This is useful when you have a unique application that isn't already packaged as a Docker image.

A Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`), on the other hand, is a configuration file used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It's used to orchestrate how a service (or multiple services) should be run. In your case, it tells Docker which pre-built image to use, which ports to expose, what volumes to mount, and how to handle restarts. It's like a blueprint for running a specific set of containers.

## Example of utilizing both Dockerfile and Docker Compose

Here's a sample `docker-compose.yml` file for a full-stack application with a front-end, back-end, and a database, where both the front-end and back-end are built from local code.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
    # Front-end service
    frontend:
        build:
            context: ./frontend
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
            - "3000:3000"
        volumes:
            - ./frontend:/app
            - /app/node_modules
        depends_on:
            - backend

    # Back-end service
    backend:
        build:
            context: ./backend
            dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
            - "5000:5000"
        volumes:
            - ./backend:/app
        environment:
            - DATABASE_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/mydatabase
        depends_on:
            - mongo

    # Database service
    mongo:
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
            - "27017:27017"
        volumes:
            - mongo-data:/data/db

volumes:
    mongo-data:
```

---

### How It Works

-   **`version: '3.8'`**: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
-   **`services`**: Defines the different components (or containers) of your application. Each service has its own configuration.
-   **`frontend`**: This service represents your front-end application (e.g., a React or Vue app).
    -   `build`: This is key. Instead of using a pre-built image, `build` tells Docker to build an image from your local code.
    -   `context: ./frontend`: Specifies the directory where the build should start. This is where your front-end's `Dockerfile` and source code are located.
    -   `dockerfile: Dockerfile`: Tells Docker which file to use for the build instructions.
    -   `ports: "3000:3000"`: Maps port `3000` on your local machine to port `3000` inside the container. This lets you access your front-end from your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
    -   `volumes`: This is crucial for local development. It creates a **bind mount** between your local `frontend` directory and the container's `/app` directory. This allows for live code changes without rebuilding the image.
-   **`backend`**: This service is for your back-end application (e.g., a Node.js Express server).
    -   `build`: Similar to the front-end, this tells Docker to build the back-end image from the local `backend` directory.
    -   `environment`: Defines an environment variable `DATABASE_URL` that the back-end can use to connect to the database container.
    -   `depends_on: - mongo`: Ensures that the `mongo` service starts before the `backend` service.
-   **`mongo`**: This service uses a pre-built database image from Docker Hub, so no local build is necessary.
    -   `image: mongo:latest`: Specifies the name of the image to pull.
    -   `volumes`: This uses a named volume (`mongo-data`) to persist the database data. This way, if you stop or remove the container, your data isn't lost.
-   **`volumes`**: Defines the named volumes used by the services.

### Corresponding Dockerfiles

This `docker-compose.yml` file assumes you have a `Dockerfile` in both your `frontend` and `backend` directories.

**`./frontend/Dockerfile` (Example for a React app)**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the built application with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**`./backend/Dockerfile` (Example for a Node.js Express app)**

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

### To Run This

1.  Place the `docker-compose.yml` file in your project's root directory.
2.  Make sure you have `frontend` and `backend` subdirectories, each with its own `Dockerfile` and code.
3.  Open your terminal in the root directory and run `docker compose up --build`.

Here is what the directory tree for the Docker Compose example would look like.

```
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── backend
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── package.json
│   └── app.js
└── frontend
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── package.json
    ├── public
    │   └── index.html
    └── src
        └── App.js
```

### Explanation of the Structure

-   **. (Root Directory)**: This is the main project folder.
-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: This file is at the root because it orchestrates all the services (frontend, backend, database) defined in the subdirectories. When you run `docker compose up` from this directory, it knows where to find the other files.
-   **`backend`**: This is a subdirectory for all your backend code.
    -   `Dockerfile`: Contains the build instructions for your backend application.
    -   `package.json`: A standard file for Node.js projects, listing dependencies and scripts.
    -   `app.js`: Your main backend application file.
-   **`frontend`**: This is a subdirectory for all your frontend code.
    -   `Dockerfile`: Contains the build instructions for your frontend application.
    -   `package.json`: A standard file for a frontend framework like React, listing dependencies and scripts.
    -   `public/` and `src/`: Standard directories for a React or similar frontend project.

This directory structure keeps the code for each service organized and separate, while the `docker-compose.yml` file acts as a central hub to connect them. The **`context`** and **`dockerfile`** fields in the `docker-compose.yml` file tell Docker where to look for each service's code and build instructions.
